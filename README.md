# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations to uncover trends and factors contributing to increased cancellation rates in two types of accommodations: Resort Hotels and City Hotels. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the data to provide actionable insights.

The goal of this analysis is to help hotel management optimize booking policies, improve revenue forecasting, and reduce cancellation rates.

## üîç Key Objectives

Investigate the cancellation trends for Resort Hotels and City Hotels.
Identify factors influencing cancellation rates.
Provide actionable insights for improving booking strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools

Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: Numerical computation.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
Seaborn: Advanced data visualization.

## üìà Key Analysis Steps

Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
Converted date columns into a readable format for better analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Visualized cancellation rates across different hotel types.

Examined trends based on:
Lead time
Booking source
Seasonality
Market segment
Insights and Findings

Identified significant differences in cancellation rates between Resort Hotels and City Hotels.
Highlighted key factors contributing to cancellations, such as lead time, booking window, and customer demographics.

## üìå Key Findings

### Resort Hotels vs. City Hotels

Resort Hotels exhibited higher cancellation rates compared to City Hotels.
Seasonality played a significant role, with peaks during holiday seasons.
Impact of Lead Time

Longer lead times were associated with higher cancellation probabilities.
Market Segment Analysis

Certain customer segments, such as those booking through Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), had higher cancellation tendencies.
Actionable Insights

Implement stricter cancellation policies for bookings with long lead times.
Offer discounts or incentives for non-refundable bookings.
Focus on improving retention for OTA customers.

## üìä Visualizations

This project includes a variety of visualizations, such as:

Bar Charts: To compare cancellation rates across different groups.
Heatmaps: To identify correlations between variables.
Line Charts: To observe trends over time.
